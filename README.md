# DzSenti
Sentiment analysis on Algerian and modern standard Arabic using deep learning and SVM.

In this work, we used the SVM and LSTM techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the Algerian and the modern standard Arabic, where we used two techniques of word embedding the Tf-IDF and the Word2Vec (CBOW model).

In this repository, you will find the Python source code used in our research and you will find also the Word2vec text corpus, our dataset and our saved models (the Word2Vec, SVM and LSTM model).

For the library and the environment that we used (Requirements) :
+ Python 3.6
+ TensorFlow
+ Scikit learn
+ Gensim
+ Anaconda environment
